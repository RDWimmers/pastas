Pastas Code Style
=================

Private Methods
---------------
Private methods in Pastas are identified by a leading underscore. E.g.:

>>> ml._get_response()

This basicly means that these methods may be removed or their behaviour may
be changed with DeprecationWarning or any other form of notice.
